# Word-Hunt-Solver
Find all possible words for the popular iOS game, Word Hunt! This program uses a custom trie data structure written in Python to efficiently validate all potential words produced by a recursive depth-first graph traversal by discarding letter chains that aren't present in the trie. A simple user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JS on the front-end, and Flask is used on the back-end.

Personally, I use this to see which major words and patterns I miss after a given Word Hunt game to improve (since you can only do this three times for free on GamePigeon), but to each their own â€” go win more Word Hunt games at https://tiger-ji-word-hunt-solver.herokuapp.com/!
